## My Website
I had worked on some React websites before this, but I wanted to truly understand the process from beginning to end of making a React website, so I made this site to learn more about React. In the process of making it, I also learned more about graphic design. After making most of the site, a UX designer provided me with a mockup of an improved design and explained some of the principles he followed while making it, and I implemented the new design.
### The Stack
This is a React website hosted on AWS with Amplify. It uses AWS Cognito, Lambda, and DynamoDB for the database demonstration on the home page. React Router is used to simulate a multi page application on a single page.
