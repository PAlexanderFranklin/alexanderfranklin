      <h1>My name is Alexander Franklin.</h1>
      <p>
        I am a web developer, which means I create websites like this. <br/>
        Really though, it means I spend lot of time googling things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't just build websites. I like to code no matter the medium, <br/>
        be it Python, or a visual language like scratch, or even a video game
        like <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/">TIS-100</a>
      </p>
